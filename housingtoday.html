							<h1>Housing Discrimination Today</h1>
							<h2>While the issue today has gone down over the years housing discrimination is still a prevalent issue</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/fair.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Even though housing discrimination may not be as prominent today it is still a huge problem in america. In today's housing market African Americans still face forms of discrimination such as invisible redlining and steering.<br><br>
<h4>Redlining:</h4> This practice is now considered illegal under the fair housing act, but many loopholes can be found to still discriminate against people of color. For example between 2009 and 2013 a huge redlining settlement occurred when the Hudson City Savings Bank excluded people of color from receiving mortgages in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. These type of instances happen all the time and show how prominent redling still is even if it may not be as visible to the public. There are also occurrences where people are denied service to utilities. These type of practices often go unnoticed but are still just as harmful as redlining of the past.<br><br>
 
<h4>Racial Steering:</h4> Racial steering is a term for when real estate agents choose specific locations for their clients dependent on their skin color. There are two practices of this, one where the agent will base if their client is qualified to buy this house solely on their skin color and another where the agent will search for houses in a location specifically known for having people of similar skin color living there. This is not nearly as much a problem for white homebuyers as it is for homebuyers of different skin colors.
